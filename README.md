# PPDT
A header-only library for preprocessor date and time parsing, similar to [my-ppmptd](https://github.com/JadLevesque/my-ppmptd).

Includes all dates between 1970-01-01 and 2106-02-07, inclusively.

### Usage
The `ppdt.h` header defines the following macros, which expand to integer literals:
- `PPDT_YEAR`
- `PPDT_MONTH`
- `PPDT_DAY`
- `PPDT_HOUR`
- `PPDT_MINUTE`
- `PPDT_SECOND`
